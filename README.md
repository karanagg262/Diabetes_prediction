# Diabetes_prediction
It is a keras program to predict whether a patient could have diabetes or not.

In try.py the training is done using the pima india dataset and the trained model is saved as a json file which is converted into hdf5.

try1.py file uses the already trained data to predict the diabetes.

pima_output.csv saves the predicted output where 0 means the patient might not have diabeted and 1 means patient could get diabetes.
